Here is some information about myself:
I have two siblings, and older brother and a younger sister, as well as a pet poodle named Sandy. 
I attend school at East Brunswick High School in New Jersey. 

I love sports, especially football and basketball, and my favorite teams are the Philadelphia 76ers and Eagles

After high school, I plan to go to college, but I plan to get into Political Science and History. I am still not sure what my future entail, but I will ready to encounter any challenges that I might face.
